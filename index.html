      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.

        "If you thought walking into a bakery with smell of buttery croissants
        baking in the oven was drool-worthy, we just upped the ante by taking
        the crown jewel of Viennoiserie and adding sweet and savory fillings.
        The final result tastes a whole lot like a juiced-up Toaster Strudel.

        This croissant makeover isn't about baking the most beautiful
        crescent-shaped pastry, but it is about creating something
        mouthwateringly delicious that can be tailored to suit anyone's taste.
        We already know that Nutella can improve just about any food, but for a
        sweet treat have you ever considered the majesty of wrapping flaky
        croissant dough around an already delectable peanut butter cup? If
        sweets aren't your thing, try our hybrid croissant-spanakopita (trendy
        Cronut-like name TBA) or make a Frenchie version of pigs in a blanket.
        <br /><br />
        Breathing an extra day of shelf life into the otherwise quick-to-stale
        pastry isn't a new concept. French patisseries sell the day-old
        croissants filled with almond cream known as croissants aux amandes.
        However, you may start to feel the phantom eye rolls from ghost French
        pastry masters past when you reach for the hot dogs or chicken parm â€” a
        small price to pay for the perfect handheld savory snack. <br /><br />If
        you have the time, make your own leavened croissant dough from scratch
        using this recipe for butter croissants, or save time by using canned
        crescent roll dough instead. Remember to follow the basic instructions
        for your croissants, including allowing your dough to proof before
        baking, these times and temperatures are guidelines, so be sure to check
        your pastries to make sure they don't burn."
